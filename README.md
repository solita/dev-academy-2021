# dev-academy-2020 excercise - Name Application

Your task is to implement a name application. The application should have an user interface. The user interface can be either a web application or an api. (It can even contain both if you have enough time and enthusiasm.) 

The user interface should provide at least the first of the following requirements, but again, you’re allowed to implement them all.
List names and amounts, order by amount, most popular first
List names in alphabetical order
Return the total amount of all the names
Return the amount of the name given as a parameter

The data for the application is stored in a json file. The material contains the top-10 of both male and female names in Solita. You can use the json file directly as your data source or you can store the data in a database if you wish.

Technologies which are used in the projects in Solita are, for example, Java, Kotlin, Clojure, TypeScript, C#, React, Angular, Vue.js, and Node.js. You can choose some of this list or use your favorite technologies.

GitHub is a good choice for version control. You can attach the repository link to your dev academy application.

Be prepared to present your implementation of the name application in the possible interview. We would like to see how the application works and discuss together the technology choices you’ve made.
